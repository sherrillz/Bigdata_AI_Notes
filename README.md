# Big Data and Artificial Intelligence for Business
Big data represents unprecedented opportunities for companies to generate insights and create wealth. Huge amount of data is being generated. At the same time, much of the big data is unstructured, in real time and only loosely connected. It defies the traditional ways of managing databases. This creates challenges even to tech-savvy companies on how to leverage the big data to gain competitive advantages. Challenges and opportunities coexist. To extract the great value from the data, we should be equipped with advanced techniques. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is penetrating our daily routines deeply, and shows great promise in exciting areas such as healthcare and autonomous driving cars. 

This course uses a hands-on, learning-by-doing approach to understanding the concepts behind Big Data and AI, the strategic drivers of these technologies and the value propositions that they provide to industries. In addition, the course will also serve as an introduction to some of the key technologies within this ecosystem, such as Hadoop, AWS, Pig, Hive, Amazon Web Services and Spark. Examples of AI using Deep Learning will be conducted in class. The focus is on creating awareness of the technologies, allowing some level of familiarity with them through hands-on exercises and projects, and enabling strategic thinking around the use of these technologies in business.
